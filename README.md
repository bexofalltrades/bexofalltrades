- 👋 Hi, I’m @bexofalltrades
- 👀 I’m interested in making video games just in general, but I'm already specialized in making art and illustrations
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the basics T-T
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything. 
- 📫 How to reach me: bexofalltrades@gmail.com is most direct but you'll have to put in extra work to not immediately be written off as spam. I'm also active on tumblr and itch.io
- 😄 Pronouns: He/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: I would love to try to bring the 'horse girl game' genre to a wider audience by combining it with a grittier monster hunter/collector rpg style
